## Abstract

L-threonic acid (threonate), a metabolite of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), has been demonstrated to facilitate magnesium transport across the blood-brain barrier when administered as magnesium L-threonate. However, commercial formulations are prohibitively expensive and contain only ~7% elemental magnesium. This hypothesis paper proposes that **high-dose ascorbic acid supplementation may generate sufficient endogenous threonate to enhance magnesium absorption systemically and cerebrally**, independent of consuming the magnesium-threonate salt. Furthermore, I propose that threonate functions as an **independent transport modulator** rather than a chelated carrier, suggesting that standalone threonate supplementation could enhance magnesium bioavailability from any dietary source.

## Introduction

### The Threonate Paradox

Magnesium L-threonate (MgT) has gained attention for its unique ability to elevate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) magnesium concentrations in rats (7-15% increase over 24 days) while other magnesium salts (citrate, chloride, glycinate, gluconate) fail to achieve this effect [1]. The mechanism involves threonate utilizing glucose transporters (GLUT1 on choroidal epithelial cells, GLUT3 on neurons) to cross biological barriers [2].

**Critical discovery:** Sun et al. (2016) demonstrated that **threonate alone, when dissociated from magnesium**, directly increases intracellular magnesium concentration in cultured hippocampal neurons [3]. This finding reveals that threonate acts as a **regulatory molecule** rather than a simple chelation vehicle.

### Implications

If threonate functions independently of magnesium:

1. **Standalone threonate supplementation** could enhance magnesium uptake from dietary sources or inexpensive magnesium salts
2. **Endogenous threonate production** from vitamin C metabolism could provide similar benefits without commercial MgT costs
3. The mechanism may extend beyond the blood-brain barrier to **general intestinal magnesium absorption**

## The Vitamin C → Threonate Metabolic Pathway

### Established Biochemistry

Ascorbic acid degradation follows this pathway:

```
Ascorbic Acid (C6) → Dehydroascorbic Acid (C6) → 
2,3-Diketogulonic Acid (C6) → Oxalic Acid (C2) + Threonic Acid (C4)
```

The C6→C4+C2 cleavage occurs between carbons 2 and 3 [4]. Threonic acid is a confirmed metabolite present in human cerebrospinal fluid and detectable in plasma following ascorbic acid administration [5].

### Recent Evidence (2026)

Kim et al. (January 2026) used [¹³C₆]-ascorbic acid tracing in mice, detecting [¹³C₄]-threonate in hypothalamic tissue 4 hours post-injection. In cultured neurons, they observed sequential metabolism: [¹³C₆]-AA → [¹³C₆]-DHA → [¹³C₆]-DKGA → [¹³C₄]-TA, confirming **in vivo cerebral conversion** of vitamin C to threonate [6].

### The Unanswered Question

**No study has quantified the dose-response relationship between oral ascorbic acid intake and systemic/cerebral threonate concentrations in humans.**

## Hypothesis: High-Dose Vitamin C as a Magnesium Bioavailability Enhancer

### Proposed Mechanism

**Primary hypothesis:** Supplementation with 10-20g daily ascorbic acid generates sufficient endogenous threonate to:

1. Cross the blood-brain barrier via GLUT transporters
2. Upregulate neuronal magnesium uptake via TRPM6/TRPM7 channels
3. Potentially enhance intestinal magnesium absorption through similar transport mechanisms
4. Create a positive feedback loop (threonate stimulates SVCT2-mediated vitamin C uptake [7])

### Quantitative Estimation

**Metabolic conversion assumptions:**
- Daily vitamin C intake: 13-16g (via magnesium/potassium ascorbate salts)
- Conservative degradation rate: 10-30% converted to threonate
- **Estimated endogenous threonate production: 1.3-4.8g daily**

**Commercial comparison:**
- Typical MgT dose: 2g (containing ~144mg Mg + ~1.8g threonate salt)
- **Hypothesis:** Endogenous production may equal or exceed commercial threonate doses

### Additional Synergy: Ascorbic Acid as a Direct Absorption Enhancer

Vitamin C is well-established to enhance:
- **Iron absorption:** Reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ and forms soluble chelates [8]
- **Calcium absorption:** pH-independent mechanisms suggest active chelation beyond acidification [9]

**Novel proposal:** The same chelation mechanisms may apply to magnesium, with the additional benefit of threonate metabolite production. This would represent a **dual-action enhancement**:

1. **Immediate:** Ascorbate salt formation increases magnesium solubility in intestinal lumen
2. **Delayed:** Metabolized threonate facilitates cellular magnesium transport

### Why This Hasn't Been Tested

Possible explanations for the research gap:

1. **Patent incentives:** Commercial MgT (Magtein®) is patented; no financial motivation to study cheaper alternatives
2. **Disciplinary silos:** Magnesium researchers and vitamin C researchers rarely collaborate
3. **Assumption bias:** Belief that the magnesium-threonate salt complex is necessary for efficacy
4. **Measurement difficulty:** Quantifying CSF threonate in humans requires invasive lumbar puncture

## Cost-Benefit Analysis: DIY Magnesium Ascorbate vs. Commercial MgT

| Parameter | Commercial MgT | DIY Magnesium Oxide + Ascorbic Acid |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Elemental Mg per dose | 144mg | 600mg |
| Threonate source | Exogenous (1.8g) | Endogenous (1.3-4.8g estimated) |
| Monthly cost (Canada) | $60-120 CAD | $1.23 CAD |
| Vitamin C bonus | None | 13.2g (antioxidant, immune support) |
| Cost per mg Mg | $0.42-0.83 | $0.002 |

**Ratio:** Commercial MgT costs **210-415× more** per mg of magnesium, with unproven superiority if the threonate-generation hypothesis is correct.

## Personal Testing Protocol

### Formulation

**Daily mixture (dissolved in 2.5L water):**
- Magnesium oxide (MgO): 1.0g → 600mg elemental Mg
- Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO₃): 2.56g → 1000mg elemental K  
- Ascorbic acid: 13.2g
  - 8.7g neutralizes MgO → magnesium ascorbate
  - 4.5g neutralizes KHCO₃ → potassium ascorbate

**Rationale:**
- Oxide provides cheapest, most concentrated Mg source (58% elemental)
- Neutralization with ascorbic acid creates soluble ascorbate salts
- High vitamin C dose maximizes threonate metabolite production
- Distributed consumption over 2.5L prevents GI distress

### Subjective Outcome Measures

Over 90-day trial periods, comparing:

1. **Baseline:** No supplementation
2. **Protocol A:** MgO + ascorbic acid (current hypothesis)
3. **Protocol B:** Magnesium glycinate + ascorbic acid (control for threonate hypothesis)
4. **Protocol C:** Commercial MgT (positive control)

**Cognitive markers:**
- Working memory performance
- Sleep quality and dream recall
- Mental clarity and focus
- Subjective stress resilience

**Physical markers:**
- Muscle cramps frequency
- Exercise recovery
- Bowel tolerance (laxative effect threshold)

### Limitations

- No objective biomarkers (serum Mg, CSF threonate, RBC Mg)
- Placebo effects cannot be controlled
- Individual metabolic variation unknown
- Not blinded or randomized
- N=1 (personal experiment only)

## Broader Implications: Is Standalone Threonate Supplementation Viable?

### The Dissociation Hypothesis

If threonate truly acts independently after dissociation from magnesium (as Sun et al. suggest), then:

**Theoretical optimal protocol:**
1. Consume cheap magnesium source (oxide, citrate) with food
2. Separately consume threonate (or threonate-generating vitamin C)
3. Allow systemic threonate to facilitate magnesium transport from dietary pool

**Advantages:**
- Higher elemental magnesium intake (not limited by low Mg% in MgT)
- Potentially lower cost if threonate could be produced or sourced independently
- Flexibility to titrate Mg and threonate doses separately

### Why Isn't Standalone Threonate Sold?

**Patent structure:** Magtein® patents may cover "threonate for cognitive enhancement" broadly, blocking competitors

**Chicken-and-egg problem:** Without human studies proving standalone threonate efficacy, no company invests in production; without commercial availability, no researchers conduct studies

**Supply chain:** Threonate is not a commodity chemical like ascorbic acid; synthesis requires specialized production

### Alternative Endogenous Production Strategies

Beyond vitamin C metabolism:
- **L-threonine supplementation?** (Different molecule; not a precursor)
- **Gut microbiome modulation?** (Unknown if bacteria produce threonate)
- **Dietary sources?** (Present in cerebrospinal fluid but dietary intake poorly characterized)

**Current best option:** High-dose vitamin C remains the only proven endogenous threonate source.

## Conclusion: A Testable Hypothesis Worth Exploring

The convergence of evidence suggests:

1. **Threonate is a metabolic facilitator, not merely a magnesium carrier**
2. **Vitamin C metabolism generates threonate in vivo, including in brain tissue**
3. **High-dose ascorbic acid may provide equivalent or superior effects to commercial MgT at <1% of the cost**
4. **The mechanism may represent a general principle:** vitamin C enhances mineral absorption through dual pathways (immediate chelation + delayed metabolite production)

### What Would Prove or Disprove This Hypothesis?

**Required human studies:**

1. **Dose-response trial:** Measure plasma and CSF threonate at 0g, 5g, 10g, 20g ascorbic acid daily
2. **Comparative efficacy:** Compare cognitive outcomes between:
   - MgO alone
   - MgO + high-dose vitamin C  
   - Commercial MgT
   - (Double-blind, randomized, n≥100 per group)
3. **Mechanism confirmation:** Use isotope-labeled vitamin C to track threonate production and distribution in humans (replicating Kim et al. 2026 in humans)
4. **Transport studies:** Measure neuronal magnesium uptake in presence of:
   - Magnesium alone
   - Threonate alone
   - Magnesium + threonate
   - (In human neuronal cell cultures or brain organoids)

### Why I'm Testing This Personally

**Scientific rationale:**
- Existing evidence is highly suggestive but incomplete
- Risk is minimal (vitamin C and magnesium are both safe at tested doses)
- Potential benefit is substantial (cognitive enhancement, cost savings, filling research gap)

**Philosophical stance:**
- N=1 experiments generate hypotheses that formal science can test
- Personal phenotype data is valuable even without statistical power
- Citizen science can identify overlooked connections in fragmented literature

**Transparency commitment:**
- This is speculation based on mechanistic reasoning, not proven fact
- I am not a medical professional or academic researcher
- Results will be shared openly regardless of outcome
- No commercial interest or financial incentive
